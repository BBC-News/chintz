    <p>I finally wrote another thing. It's about <a href="./sikhote-alin-meteorite.php">a meteorite fragment I got for my birthday</a>. Any other bits and pieces will also end up filed under <a href="./diversions.php">diversions</a>.</p>
    <p>I work for a <a href="//www.bbc.co.uk/news">super-serious news organisation</a>, where I enjoy making responsive, accessible, performant websites. I'm on <a href="//uk.linkedin.com/in/peterchamberlin">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="//twitter.com/#!/pgchamberlin">Twitter</a> so feel free to say hi there.</p>
    <p>Looking for some peace and quiet? Try <a href="__.php">this blank page</a>.</p>
